<h1>oops in c++ definition</h1>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++ is a programming model that organizes software around objects instead of functions and logic:</p>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>User-defined data types that act as blueprints for objects</p>
<h3>Objects:</h3>
<p>Instances of a class created with specific data</p>
<h3>Methods: </h3>
<p>Functions that objects can perform</p>
<h3>Attributes:</h3>
<p>Represent the state of an object</p>
<p>OOP in C++ helps developers design and structure code in a way that models real-world entities. This makes software more intuitive, flexible, and maintainable</p>
